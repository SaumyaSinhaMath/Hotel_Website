<h1 style="color:Indianred"><center> <font face="algerian"> Story behind this beautiful Palace </font> </h1>
<font face="monotype corsiva" size=5>
<p> <center> <b>The history of building Khwabeeda Palace is linked to a curse by a saint who said that a period of drought would follow the good rule of the Rathore 
<br> Dynasty.</p>
<p>In 1920s, Jodhpur faced severe drought and famine, for a period of three consecutive years. The farmers were severely affected by this famine and 
<br> sought help from the then Maharaja Umaid Singh, who was the 37th Ruler at Jodhpur.</p>
<p>In order to help farmers, Maharaja decided to build two lavish palaces. Through this he aimed to provide employment to those famine-stricken <br> farmers.
He commissioned the construction of Khwabeeda Palace and Umaid Bhawan to Henry Vaughen Lanchester.</p>
<p>Expensive venture employing the needy was not only a beautiful royal residence but a symbol of hope. The hardworking people got enough to <br> survive 
through the bad times. The palace was designed as a blend of western and Indian architecture. Upon its construction the palace looked <br> pleasantly unreal and dreamy, from 
where it got its name, <i>KHWABEEDA</i>.</p>
<p>After many years, in 1970, the then Maharaja Gaj Singh II, decided to convert the entire Khwabeeda Palace into a heritage hotel for the world to 
<br> experience royalty and richness.</p>
