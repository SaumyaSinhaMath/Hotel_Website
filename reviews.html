<div class="Review">Excellent service provided by the hotel 
staff. Especially the staff from 24/7 where we had our 
lunch & dinner we had excellent food with an excellent service. 
Me and family really liked the hotel, the rooms were well maintained with comfy beds. Will recommend my
 friends to stay here if they are visiting Jodhpur</div>

<div class="Review">Very well maintained hotel and rooms. All the staff were very friendly and courteous. We arrived earlier than expected by a few hours and our room was prioritised in terms and we were able to check in early free of charge. This was very helpful and appreciated as we were quite tired after a long flight</div>

Same was provided promptly without Any extra charge. Good variety of breads were available for vegetarians also, which was helpful as some of our family members are strictly vegetarian</div>
